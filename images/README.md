# Project Images Guide

## 📁 How to Add Project Images

Simply place your project images in this folder with these exact names:

### Required Files:
- `fortnite-calculator.jpg` - Fortnite Drop Calculator project
- `japanese-dictionary.jpg` - Japanese Dictionary App project  
- `climbsight.jpg` - ClimbSight project
- `langapp.jpg` - LanGAPP project

### File Requirements:
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: Recommend 800x800px or larger (square aspect ratio works best)
- **File size**: Keep under 2MB for fast loading

### Easy Steps:
1. Rename your project screenshot to match the exact filename above
2. Copy it to this `public/images/` folder
3. Replace the existing placeholder file
4. Refresh your website - the image will appear automatically!

### Example:
```
public/
└── images/
    ├── fortnite-calculator.jpg  ← Your Fortnite project screenshot
    ├── japanese-dictionary.jpg  ← Your Japanese app screenshot  
    ├── climbsight.jpg          ← Your climbing analysis screenshot
    └── langapp.jpg             ← Your translation app screenshot
```

**Note**: If an image is missing, you'll see a helpful placeholder showing exactly which file to add.
